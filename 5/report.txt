   [HINT] independent set is a set where no two numbers are neighbors in the original list.
   	  see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_set_(graph_theory)

   input:  a list of numbers (could be negative)
   output: a pair of the max sum and the list of numbers chosen

   Q: What's the complexity?

O(n)
